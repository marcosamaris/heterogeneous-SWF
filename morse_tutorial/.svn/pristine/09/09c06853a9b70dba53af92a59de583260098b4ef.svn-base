* Troubleshouting

- *libgfortran* library should be available in the environnement because
  we do not intend to build it through Spack.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :session spack :exports code :results none
export LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/libgfortran:$LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/libgfortran:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/libgfortran:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
#+END_SRC

** Mac OS X
Libraries on which <<pastix>> relies like metis are not fully capable
of building shared libraries on Mac OS X so that we advice to build
the stack in static (~shared).

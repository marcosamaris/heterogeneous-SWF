Matrices Over Runtime Systems @ Exascale (MORSE)

As pointed by Samuel, the goal of the Matrices Over Runtime Systems @ Exascale (MORSE)
project is to set up an open collaborative framework to design scientific, high performance
libraries (espcially numerical linear algebra, but not limited to) with a task-based approach

I have downloaded each one of them: 
* Chameleon:Chameleon is a dense linear algebra library derived from the Plasma (http://icl.cs.utk.edu/plasma/) and Magma (http://icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/) projects. 
Its specificity is to rely on top of runtime systems for exploiting various complex hardware architectures such as multicore and heterogeneous nodes or supercomputers. 

Cholesky factorization of dense matrices: it involves 4 different kernels (POTRF, TRSM, SYRK and GEMM) 
SYRK - Symetric Rank Update
The GEMM routine is described as the general matrix-matrix multiply 
TRSM - Triangular 
The TRSM routine is described as back substitution with multiple right hand sides using
a triangular matrix. Solves a triangular matrix equation.
DPOTRF - computes the Cholesky factorization

* PaStiX (Parallel Sparse matriX package) is a scientific library that provides a high performance parallel solver for very large sparse linear systems based on direct methods.  

Numerical algorithms are implemented in single or double precision (real or complex) using LLt, LDLt and LU with static pivoting (for non symmetric matrices having a symmetric pattern).  
This solver provides also an adaptive blockwise iLU(k) factorization that can be used as a parallel preconditioner using approximated supernodes to build a coarser block structure of the incomplete factors.
